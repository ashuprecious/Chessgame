# Snake Game in React

This is a simple Snake game built using React. The game allows you to control a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can check if you have it installed by running:

```
node -v
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd snake-game-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```
npm start

This will start the development server and open the game in your default web browser.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
